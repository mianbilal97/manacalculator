          Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a complex trading card game where mana management plays a crucial role in deck construction and gameplay success. The MTG Mana Calculator is an essential tool designed to help players optimize their deck's mana base, ensuring consistent and efficient gameplay across various formats and strategies.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">The Importance of Proper Mana Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          A well-balanced mana base is fundamental to any successful MTG deck. It determines your ability to cast spells efficiently, maintain tempo, and execute your strategy effectively. The calculator takes into account various factors including converted mana costs (CMC), color requirements, and deck composition to provide accurate recommendations for land distribution.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Advanced Calculation Methods</h3>
        <p>
          Our calculator employs sophisticated algorithms that consider multiple factors when determining optimal mana distribution. These include:
          - Total number of non-land cards
          - Combined converted mana costs
          - Color intensity requirements
          - Deck archetype considerations
          - Format-specific adjustments
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Optimizing Your Mana Base</h3>
        <p>
          The calculator helps players avoid common pitfalls in deck construction by providing data-driven recommendations. It considers:
          - Color requirements for early-game plays
          - Double and triple color requirements
          - Curve considerations
          - Land-to-spell ratio optimization
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Format Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Different MTG formats require different approaches to mana base construction. Whether you're building for Standard, Modern, Commander, or Limited, understanding format-specific requirements is crucial for optimal deck performance.
